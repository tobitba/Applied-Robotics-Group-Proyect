    0. paths points are 2D [x,y] coordinates in the world frame
    1. past path goes from oldest entry to newest in indeces
    2. we want a point on the path that's cfg.base_to_handlebar_preferred_distance in arclength
    3. by minusing the whole path from the current point, we get relative distances of the path
       points from the current point
    4. to make life easier, we linearly interpolate between the path point.
    5. we add the lengths of lines between path points until we reach cfg.base_to_handlebar_preferred_distance
    6. we return the index of the path point to make further math easier

    #  construct timed SE3 path for the end-effector  #
    ###################################################
    this works as follow:
        1) find the previous path point of arclength base_to_handlebar_preferred_distance.
        first part of the path is from there to current base position,
        second is just the current base's plan.
        2) construct timing on the first part. (robot.dt =/= ocp_dt)
        3) (optional) join that with the already timed second part.
            --> not doing this because paths are super short and this won't ever happen with the current setup
        4) turn the timed 2D path into an SE3 trajectory

    (1) NOTE: BIG ASSUMPTION
        let's say we're computing on time, and that's the time spacing
        of previous path points.
        this means you need to lower the control frequency argument
        if you're not meeting deadlines.
        if you really need timing information, you should actually
        get it from ControlLoopManager instead of i,
        but let's say this is better because you're forced to know
        how fast you are instead of ducktaping around delays.
    TODO: actually save timing, pass t instead of i to controlLoops
        from controlLoopManager
    NOTE: this might not working when rosified
