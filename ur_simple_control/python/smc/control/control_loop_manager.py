    ControlLoopManager
    -------------------
    Slightly fancier programming (passing a function as argument and using functools.partial)
    to get a wrapper around the control loop.
    In other words, it's the book-keeping around the actual control loop.
    It's a class because it keeps non-directly-control-loop-related parameters
    like max_iterations, what data to save etc.
    NOTE: you give this the ready-made control loop.
    if it has arguments, bake them in with functools.partial.
    Handles short-term data saving and logging.
    Details on this are given below.

    Short term data saving:
            - it's a dictionaries of deques (initialized here), because deque is the most convenient class
              for removing the first element and appending a last (it is just a linked list under the hood of course).
            - it's a dictionary for modularity's sake, because this way you can save whatever you want
            - and it will just work based on dictionary keys.
            - it is the user's resposibility to make sure they're providing correct data.
            - --> TODO but make an assert for the keys at least
            - in the c++ imlementation, make the user write their own struct or something.
            - since this is python, you need to give me initial values to infer types.
            - you need to provide initial values to populate the deque to start anyway.

    Logging data (for analysis and plotting):
            - it can only be handled here because the control loop itself only cares about the present/
              a small time-window around it.
            - saves it all in a dictionary of ndarrays (initialized here), returns that after a run
              TODO: it's provided by the user now, make it actually initialize here!!!
            - you need to specify which keys you're using to do the initialization
            - later, the controlLoop needs to return what's to be save in a small temporary dict.
            - NOTE: this is of course a somewhat redundant solution, but it's the simplest
              and most flexible way of doing it.
              it probably will be done some other way down the line, but it works and is not
              a priority right now

    Other info:
    - relies on RobotManager to handle all the magic numbers
      that are not truly only control loop related
