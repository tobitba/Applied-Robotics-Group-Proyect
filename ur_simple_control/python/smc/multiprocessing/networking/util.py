"""
to make the data API uniform across the library (dictionaries),
we need to have a lookup function between these dictionaries 
and messages send with protobuf.
i don't want to see protobuf construction in my control loop aight.

this is done as follows.
there is a map between a binary number and messages.
the binary number is of fixed length, and each bit represents
a boolean for whether a specific quantity is in the keys of the dictionary.
it is initialized to all zeros (false)
when a dictionary is inputed, the function goes over every key and sets
the corresponding value.
of course for every combination there is a pre-defined message in protobuf.
(well it won't be, that's a todo because it might be better
to have a big message with optional fields or something).
the output is a message with the message values put in.

is this the best way of dealing with enabling unifromness in the API?
is this the best way to construct protobuf messages?
i don't know, but it solves my most important problem - i don't
want to look at protobuf in the rest of the code
