general
-----------
Estimate a plane by making multiple contacts with it. 
You need to start with a top left corner of it,
and you thus don't need to find an offset (you have to know it in advance).
TODO: test and make sure the above statement is in fact correct.
Thus the offset does not matter, we only need the angle,
i.e. the normal vector to the plane.
Returns R because that's what's needed to construct the hom transf. mat.
