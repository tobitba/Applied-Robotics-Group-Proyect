    - z will go away from the board
    - y just completes the right-hand frame

    NOTE: this function as well be in the util or drawing file, but whatever for now, it will be done
          once it will actually be needed elsewhere
    Returns a 3D path appropriately scaled, and placed into the first quadrant
    of the x-y plane of the body-frame (TODO: what is the body frame if we're general?)
